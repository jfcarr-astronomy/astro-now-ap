# astro-now-ap

Generates astronomical observation data in JSON format.

**Coming Soon**

This is intended as a replacement for [astro-now](https://github.com/jfcarr-astronomy/astro-now).  astro-now relies on pyephem, which is deprecated.

astro-now-ap uses [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/), the common core package for astronomy in Python.
